## Description

This is a tranformation of meteors official Todo tutorial to work with typescript and the react
renderer. It tries to have the minimal number of dependencies and least complex build mechanism
while still trying to give a pleasant development experience

- Auto build on save
- Auto refresh browser on change
- Keep state on the client even when client side code changes



## Usage:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Aranir/meteor-react-typescript-todo.git
cd meteor-react-typescript-todo
typings install
npm start
```
